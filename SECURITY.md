# Reporting Security Issues
The SaaSquatch team takes security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

To report a security issue, email security@referralsaasquatch.com and provide as much information as you can about the discovered issue.

The SaaSquatch team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module.
